Commands:

/dance [ID], like /dance 1, /dance 2, and /dance 3
The ID's are ordened automatically depending on the order in music.xml.


To add a new track, take these steps:
- copy the subfolder and rename to trackname
- copy a definition.xml from another song's subfolder and paste it in the new one
- in that definition.xml of the new folder, edit the song title in beginning and also change file="foldername/track.mp3" to how the actual song folder is called
- add the song .mp3 in the subfolder, as track.mp3
- add the foldername/track.mp3 and foldername/definitions.xml (of the newly added song) to meta.xml (file src, copy rows..)
- open music.xml in resource root and add entry like <music definition="foldername/definition.xml" /> (or else the script cannot find the newly added song)

If you made a mistake with above steps, the resource cannot locate and play the track and will output debug warning to clientscript.log, like commonly: dance\main.lua:*: dance: Bad track number specified

NOTE: It's recommended to take out more time when you add new songs, to edit the Dance move timings (in definition.xml, called like ''<press key="forwards" tick="14860" />'')
so that the tapping moves actually feels nice to dance to with that song.

I also gotta say, that the current songs added by default are NOT ideal per the tapping times, they are identical across all songs (generic). So there's some work to do to make the dancing feel more satisfying.
